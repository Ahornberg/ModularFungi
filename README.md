### Omri has posted the following message:- ###

So we decided, for now, not to update the Modular Fungi collection to V2. I’m not 100% happy with the blanks, and there’s no need anymore for the Light Off module so all there’s left is the Opsylloscope. It’s quite a cool scope but we would like to improve it sometime in the future, maybe even add other modules and change the blanks designs so, for now, there’s no need to port the collection. I know that it’s not a big collection, and probably will not cause any issues if not ported, but it’s important for me that it will not be ported for now. Thanks!
